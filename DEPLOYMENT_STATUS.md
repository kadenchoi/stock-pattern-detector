## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Cross-Platform Database Layer
- **Desktop:** SQLite via `sqflite` package
- **Web:** Hive browser storage via `hive_flutter` package
- **Abstraction:** `PlatformDatabaseService` automatically selects appropriate implementation

### Cross-Platform Alert System
- **Desktop:** Native macOS notifications via `flutter_local_notifications`
- **Web:** HTML5 notifications via `dart:html` APIs
- **Abstraction:** `AlertManagerFactory` with interface-based implementation

### Code Structure
- **No Platform Imports:** Eliminated `dart:html` import conflicts
- **Factory Pattern:** Platform-specific implementations without conditional imports
- **Stub Implementations:** Safe fallbacks for non-web platforms
- **Interface Compatibility:** Unified method signatures across platforms
