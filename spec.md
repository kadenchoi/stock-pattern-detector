üìÑ Project Specification: AI-based Stock Pattern Detection Tool

1. Overview

A macOS desktop app built using Flutter, designed to:

Fetch stock price data from Yahoo Finance,

Detect technical chart patterns from time-series data,

Alert users based on pattern detection signals,

Support custom stock watchlists and alert preferences.

2. Key Features

2.1. Stock Data Source

Provider: Yahoo Finance (via public APIs or web scraping libraries like yahoo_fin, yfinance via FFI or isolate service)

Fetch Interval: Configurable by user

Supported Data Frequencies:

1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 90m, 1h, 1d, 5d, 1wk, 1mo, 3mo

2.2. Stock Watchlist

User can input an array of stock symbols (e.g., ["AAPL", "TSLA", "NVDA"])

Watchlist is persistent and editable

UI allows easy add/remove/reorder functionality

2.3. Pattern Detection

Supported Patterns (from uploaded reference):

Head and Shoulders (bearish)

Cup and Handle (bullish)

Double Top / Bottom (bearish/bullish)

Triangle, Ascending / Descending Triangle (breakout)

Flag, Wedge, Pennant (breakout)

AI/ML/Heuristic models scan OHLCV time-series for visual match

Match % score (e.g., 80% match) is calculated and shown

Direction prediction: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è bullish / ‚¨áÔ∏è bearish

2.4. Local Storage & Caching

Store OHLCV historical data locally in SQLite or Hive

Retain historical analysis results

Auto-refresh based on interval settings

2.5. Alerts

Triggered when a pattern match score exceeds a user-defined threshold

Alert methods:

macOS push notification

Email (via SMTP or API like SendGrid/Mailgun)

Alert content includes:

Stock symbol

Pattern name

Direction (up/down)

Match score

Snapshot (optional chart image)

2.6. Settings Panel

Tracking Interval: e.g., every 1m, 15m, 1h

Alert Method: Email / Push / Both

Pattern Match Threshold: e.g., 70% match

Data Period for Analysis:

Dropdown menu with: 1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 90m, 1h, 1d, 5d, 1wk, 1mo, 3mo

3. Architecture Overview

3.1. Modules

data_service: fetch & cache Yahoo Finance data

pattern_analyzer: ML / heuristic engine to detect patterns

alert_manager: triggers and delivers alerts

ui_module: macOS-specific UI (Flutter macOS support)

settings_manager: persists user preferences

3.2. Suggested Libraries

flutter_local_notifications

mailer (for email)

flutter_secure_storage (for storing API keys, if needed)

charts_flutter or syncfusion_flutter_charts (for visual backtesting)

ffmpeg_kit_flutter (if generating chart snapshots from data)

4. User Flow

Initial Setup

User launches app ‚Üí prompted to input stock codes ‚Üí selects alert interval ‚Üí chooses data period ‚Üí app begins polling & analyzing

Pattern Detection

For each stock:

Fetch OHLCV ‚Üí store data ‚Üí scan for patterns ‚Üí if matched ‚Üí trigger alert

Alert Notification

‚Äúüö® Pattern Detected: Cup and Handle on TSLA, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Potential Breakout. Confidence: 87%‚Äù

5. Roadmap / Optional Enhancements

Add backtesting feature

Include visual candlestick chart with overlaid pattern highlights

Integrate with brokerage APIs for simulated or real trading

Add dark/light mode switch

Export pattern alerts to CSV or PDF
